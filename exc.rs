//! Two-level BPF exception handling.
//!
//! Demonstrates the .bpf_cleanup section added in LLVM 23 by 9d51c891b719
//! ("[BPF] Add exception handling support with .bpf_cleanup section").
//!
//! Call chain:
//!
//!   entry -> foo1 -> foo2 -> foo3
//!
//! foo3 and foo2 both hold resources acquired with kfuncs and both can
//! throw.  Each of them therefore gets an `invoke` + `landingpad cleanup`
//! that runs the Drop impls (i.e. the "undo" kfunc calls) and then
//! `resume`s, which lowers to `call _Unwind_Resume`.  The BPF AsmPrinter
//! records one (begin, end, landing_pad) triple per invoke region in
//! .bpf_cleanup, so at run time the kernel redirects each unwinding frame
//! to its landing pad:
//!
//!   frame foo3: re-enable preemption   (bpf_preempt_enable)
//!   frame foo2: leave the RCU section  (bpf_rcu_read_unlock), drop tracker
//!   frame foo1: no cleanup entry -> kernel just pops the frame
//!
//! Two things are required to get this out of rustc:
//!
//!  1. panic=unwind, from -C panic=unwind plus panic-strategy=unwind in
//!     bpfel-unknown-none-v4.json.  Under panic=abort every landing pad is
//!     optimized away.
//!  2. the "C-unwind" ABI on foo1/foo2/foo3/entry.  Plain extern "C" is
//!     nounwind in Rust: the foo2 -> foo3 call would get no unwind edge, and
//!     the abort-on-unwind shim (core::panicking::panic_cannot_unwind) emits
//!     a `landingpad filter`, which the BPF backend rejects with
//!     "BPF does not support exception filters yet".
//!
//! The guards deliberately use kfunc pairs that the verifier tracks itself,
//! bpf_rcu_read_lock/bpf_rcu_read_unlock and
//! bpf_preempt_disable/bpf_preempt_enable.  A landing pad that never ran, or
//! that the kernel failed to make reachable, leaves the region unbalanced and
//! the program does not load at all.  Each Drop additionally adds a distinct
//! bit to the in-flight exception cookie via bpf_cleanup_ran(), so the value
//! the program returns says exactly which pads ran.
//!
//! Every kfunc used here takes either no arguments or integers: the BTF
//! prototypes in .ksyms are synthesised from the LLVM declaration (see
//! add_ksyms.py) and libbpf checks them against the kernel's, so struct
//! pointer arguments would need the real kernel types to be reconstructed.
//!
//! Unlike the scx_* programs, this one is built by the EH_PROGS rules in the
//! Makefile: an LLVM >= 23 toolchain, and add_ksyms.py run with KEEP_INVOKE=1
//! so the invoke/landingpad pairs survive into codegen.
