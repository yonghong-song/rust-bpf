//! Multi-frame BPF exception handling, written in Rust.
//!
//! The compiler side of the feature is the .bpf_cleanup section added in LLVM
//! 23 by 9d51c891b719 ("[BPF] Add exception handling support with
//! .bpf_cleanup section"): a flat array of (begin, end, landing_pad) triples,
//! one per `invoke` region, saying that a frame unwinding out of a call in
//! [begin, end) has to run landing_pad before it is popped.  Rust Drop glue is
//! what produces those regions today, which is what this program is: the C
//! counterpart, progs/exceptions_cleanup.c, has to spell the same thing out in
//! __naked assembly because C has no unwinding.
//!
//! Call chain:
//!
//!   entry -> foo1 -> foo2 -> foo3
//!
//! foo3 and foo2 both hold resources acquired with kfuncs and both can throw.
//! Each of them therefore gets an `invoke` + `landingpad cleanup` that runs the
//! Drop impls (i.e. the "undo" kfunc calls) and then `resume`s, which lowers to
//! `call _Unwind_Resume` - the kernel's bpf_unwind_resume kfunc, which libbpf
//! maps that name onto.  bpf_unwind() walks the frames and dispatches each one's
//! pad:
//!
//!   frame foo3: re-enable preemption   (bpf_preempt_enable)
//!   frame foo2: leave the RCU section  (bpf_rcu_read_unlock), drop tracker
//!   frame foo1: no cleanup entry -> the frame is just popped
//!   frame entry: the exception boundary
//!
//! Two things are required to get this out of rustc:
//!
//!  1. panic=unwind, from -C panic=unwind plus panic-strategy=unwind in
//!     bpfel-unknown-none-v4.json.  Under panic=abort every landing pad is
//!     optimized away.
//!  2. the "C-unwind" ABI on foo1/foo2/foo3/entry.  Plain extern "C" is
//!     nounwind in Rust: the foo2 -> foo3 call would get no unwind edge, and
//!     the abort-on-unwind shim (core::panicking::panic_cannot_unwind) emits
//!     a `landingpad filter`, which the BPF backend rejects with
//!     "BPF does not support exception filters yet".
//!
//! The guards deliberately use kfunc pairs that the verifier tracks itself,
//! bpf_rcu_read_lock/bpf_rcu_read_unlock and
//! bpf_preempt_disable/bpf_preempt_enable.  A landing pad that never ran, or
//! that the kernel failed to make reachable, leaves the region unbalanced and
//! the program does not load at all.  On top of that each Drop sets its own bit
//! in PADS_RAN, so the value left in .bss names exactly the pads that ran.  A
//! pad runs as a subroutine of bpf_unwind(), so a side effect like this is
//! the only way to see a pad from user space.
//!
//! Every kfunc used here takes either no arguments or integers, because the
//! BTF prototypes in .ksyms are synthesised from the LLVM declaration and
//! libbpf checks them against the kernel's: a struct pointer argument would
//! need the real kernel type reconstructed to stay compatible.
